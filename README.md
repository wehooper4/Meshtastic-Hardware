# Meshtastic-Hardware

This repository is a collection of my hardware designs generally compatable with the Meshtastic firmware or other opensource mesh radio projects. It contains designs ranging from fully open-source projects for personal experimentation to commercially available hardware via partners.

Please navigate to the specific project folder for detailed information, documentation, and a project-specific disclaimer regarding intended use, licensing, and availability.

All designs, regardless of their status, are intended for use in compliance with local regulations. Users are responsible for ensuring their operation adheres to all applicable laws.

**Disclaimer:** This hardware is provided for personal experimentation, research, and educational purposes. If you plan to use this hardware for wireless communications, you are solely responsible for ensuring that it complies with all local regulations, including those set by the FCC. Designs intended for amateur radio (Part 97) use must be operated by a licensed amateur radio operator.
