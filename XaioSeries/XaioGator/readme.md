## Client Node

The name XaioGator playfully come from the ham term "alligator", refering to a radio setup wth all mouth (lots of TX power) but no ears. That's not exacly the case with these, because even though they do have elevated TX power the eByte E22 radios these are based on have a 15-18db LNA. But as the early prototypes where called alligatos, it was decided to lean into it.

These are client focused nodes inteded to toss on a bag or mount in a car. Some varients have secondary solar capablity, but are not a full featured as the XolarXao
